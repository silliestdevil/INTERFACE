Overview

Access Denied challenges the conventional practice of demanding personal data to enter online spaces. This innovative interface adopts a gaming format where users navigate challenges to gain access. Instead of requiring personal information upfront, the journey through the game becomes the means to access the desired online space, promoting a more user-friendly and privacy-conscious experience.

Getting Started
